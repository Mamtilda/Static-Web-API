# Static-Web-API
This project connects a static website with backend API functionality. The project demonstrates how to integrate dynamic API endpoints with a static front-end website. The front-end consists of simple HTML and CSS for a clean and responsive design, while the back-end is powered by Spring Boot to provide API services.

This project serves as a functional static website with basic API interaction to enhance user experience without the complexity of a fully dynamic application.

# Features
- Static Front-End: Built with HTML and CSS for a clean and responsive design that works on all devices.
- API Integration: Simple backend APIs created with Spring Boot that handle form submissions and provide responses.
- Navigation: Seamless navigation between the pages such as Home, About, Gallery, and Contact.
- Form Handling: Users can submit data through a contact form, which the backend API processes, with success or failure messages returned to the user.

# Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Java 11 or higher: The backend is powered by Spring Boot, which requires Java.
- Maven: To manage dependencies and build the application.
- IDE: A Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

# Running Spring Application
mvn spring-boot:run is executed in the IDE project's terminal to run Spring.
